- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kuragari-kun
- 👀 I’m interested in design (drawing on graphic table, making projects in Figma, Canva, any type of logos or emojis in Inkscape and now I starting to work with Zoner and Photoshop)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, TypeScript, C# but it's terrible...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing -_- XD
